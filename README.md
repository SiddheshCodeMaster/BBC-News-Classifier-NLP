# BBC-News-Classifier-NLP

I am going to classify the BBC News. This news dataset is taken from kaggle.
Here's the link:

The project aim is to take in an input string i.e. a text and it will generate a label for it. 

For example:
I pass the sentence " Messi is the greatest footballer of all time i.e. GOAT."

It should tell me using classifier algorithms that it is a text related to **"sport"**.

I have used SGD classifier with 95 % accuracy. 

I have followed all the steps regarding NLP project.

For testing of the flask application, I have used Postman API software. It is really very easy to use Postman API for testing the responses of the application we create. I have used **POST** method so that we send a text as an input and the application generates a label in response.
